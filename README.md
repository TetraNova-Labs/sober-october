# 1) Project Description üìö

**October Challenge Tracker** is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA)
designed to help individuals and groups set, track, and achieve their October
‚Äúsober month‚Äù fitness challenges (as together or against each other)
The challenge participants can define custom goals (running distance),
exercises, etc. ‚Äîlog daily progress (manually or via third-party APIs like Strava),
and capture photos or short videos of their activities.
The app works offline, syncs when back online, and provides progress visualizations,
leaderboards, and reminders to keep everyone motivated throughout October.
